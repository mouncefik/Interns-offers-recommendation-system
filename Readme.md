## TfidfVectorizer :
 is a class in scikit-learn (sklearn) that converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features. It's a powerful tool for text analysis and is often used in tasks like document classification, information retrieval, and clustering.


## Cosine similarity 

is a metric used to measure the similarity between two non-zero vectors. It's often used in text analysis, information retrieval, and recommendation systems to compare documents or items based on their features. It essentially calculates the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.

Formula:

The cosine similarity between two vectors A and B is calculated as:

copy
cosine_similarity(A, B) = (A Â· B) / (||A|| * ||B||)


## similarity matrix or resemblance matrix :
 is a matrix that quantifies the similarity between pairs of items in a dataset. Each entry (i, j) in the matrix represents the similarity between item i and item j.
